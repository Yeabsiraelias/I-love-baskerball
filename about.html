        <h2> My High School Basketball Journey</h2>
         <p>High school basketball was where everything changed for me. It wasn’t just about playing a sport — it was about finding a deeper part of myself. Early morning practices, late-night games, and the constant drive to improve helped shape who I am. I learned how to lead, how to take criticism, and how to rise after failure. Being part of a team taught me discipline, responsibility, and the power of trust. Some of my best memories were made under the lights of those packed gyms, with the crowd cheering and everything on the line.

College ball pushed me to grow not just as a player, but as a person. It taught me resilience, time management, and what it really means to dedicate yourself to something bigger than you</p>
