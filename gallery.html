          <h1>How It Inspires Me</h1>
<p calas="ano">Basketball inspires me to push my limits. Watching my favorite players perform with skill, grace, and determination motivates me to do better — not just on the court, but in life. The sport is a constant reminder that hard work pays off, and that greatness is built day by day through consistent effort and love for what you do.

                        <h3>Kobe Bryant</h3>
                        <p>Kobe Bryant inspires me because of his relentless work ethic, fearless mindset, and commitment to greatness. His “Mamba Mentality” taught me that success isn’t about talent alone — it’s about putting in the work when no one’s watching, staying focused through failure, and never settling for less than your best. Watching Kobe play made me fall in love with the game, and his legacy pushes me to keep growing every time I step on the court.

                        <p>LeBron James inspires me because of his versatility, leadership, and dedication both on and off the court. He’s more than just one of the greatest players of all time — he’s a true example of how to use talent, hard work, and intelligence to dominate the game and uplift others. The way he consistently performs at the highest level, even after so many years, motivates me to stay disciplined and never stop improving. LeBron shows me that greatness is earned through consistency, focus, and purpose.
