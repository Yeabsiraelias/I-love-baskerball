        <h2>My Love for the Game</h2>
    <p>Basketball has been more than just a sport to meâ€”it's been a passion, a teacher, and a lifelong companion. From the first time I picked up a ball, I felt something click. The rhythm of the game, the way a team moves in sync, and the challenge of constant growth pulled me in and never let go.</p>
