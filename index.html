        <br>
        <br>
    <p>Basketball has been more than just a sport to me—it's been a passion, a teacher, and a lifelong companion. From the first time I picked up a ball, I felt something click. The rhythm of the game, the way a team moves in sync, and the challenge of constant growth pulled me in and never let go.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
<p>For me, basketball is more than just a sport — it's a way of life. It teaches me patience, persistence, and teamwork. Every dribble, pass, and shot is a reminder that success takes effort and practice. I've learned valuable life lessons on the court that I carry with me every day. It's where I feel most alive, most challenged, and most at peace.
